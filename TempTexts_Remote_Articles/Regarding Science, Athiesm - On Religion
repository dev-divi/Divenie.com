Regarding What is Logical?

Rejecting the Burden of Proof paraphrased, `
There are those who will refuse to accept that the burden of proof rests with those making positive claims.  They do want to claim that:
"[the supernatural] exists unless someone proves that [does] not exist."

They want to have their beliefs remain intact in X being true, not on evidence and reason but on faith.
Such behavior is in the realm of religion.
Those who behave in this manner are rejecting the use of reason."

This author, makes the most compelling possible argument not for, but against, athiesm.

# Understanding

Solomon's proverb said,
"Do not lean on your own understanding;" ~Proverbs 3:5-6
This means that ~~To ‘lean not on your own understanding’ is really just another way of saying we need to live by faith. -faithisland.org~~

This does not mean to *live by faith*. It identifies that there is a limited understanding and not to rely on it.

Man today has placed his faith in what he is calling *reason*, but most of man does not even know what this is and what he is putting his faith into.
Man has leaned on his lower understanding.
The modern man assumes that reason means, *things that are concretely true or real*.

We should look into and understand what this reason that we are placing faith into really is.
What we are really talking about is the field of man's study of the great Logos, of logic.
We agree today that logic is a formal science and that it is the study of good reasoning and correct arguments.

I will reclassify logic in order to break it down to say that,
Logic is the practice of using the mind to make conclusive arguments about reality and then placing faith in the position of those arguments as being true.
But still, how do you know what is logic and what is not?
If I say, this ball is a square, am I using logic? Am I using reasoning? What is good reasoning?
You see that there is no such thing yet, I will define it.

# Creating a system

To do that I have to create a system that defines what is logical and what is not.
*"When used as a countable noun, the term "a logic" refers to a logical formal system."*
To practice logic means that I will have to create *a system of rules* to define good reasoning.
Optimally, others will need to agree with me that my rules are good rules.
Then, I will have to place faith in my system of rules, on faith.
Logic, the study of the laws of thought, when used to determine what is true, is religion.

For the burden of proof author to state that, "those who behave in this manner are rejecting the use of reason"
Is literally saying, "they are rejecting my religion". This is the religion of upholding the understanding of the mind of thoughts.
Those who don't understand that this focus as a religion are living by blind faith.

The modern man does not know logic as a system of rules of thought in this way.
He knows logic to mean a specific system that values what it understands as being true.
This system is not the system of what is real and not real.
This system is the system of defining what is real based on what we can understand.

# The New Observer

Now this could be understood by one creating the rules for logic. But the newcomer onto the scene, he does not know logic in this way.
He has not thought about what is logic. The average person has been told what is true, and he has been given the rules to the system
that is being used and instructed to operate by it, and he, by blind faith, has believed in this.
This creates an imposed ideological belief system.
This belief system thinks, "Other people have concluded what is real and true and I believe them."
It goes on to be the belief system that says,
"If I can see it, measure it, observe it, then it is true."
"If I can figure it out, then it is true."
"If I cannot understand it, it does not exist."
This changes a world view of existence from being a place that we hardly understand at all,
to the comfort of a world that we completely understand. We understand it all. We take great comfort in knowing exactly what is and what is not.

# Peek-A-Boo!

We were once children and went to school, and we relied on teachers to give us information about what we knew about our existence.
Those teachers gave us the gift of establishing what was true for us in order for us. We grow up expecting the world to be the same,
that teachers know what is going on, that other people have figured it all out and that their understanding can be put faith in.

This understanding has granted us temporary relief from confusion, however the average reader should be able to see the ludicrousy in the belief system when observed from a distance in this way.
We can see that "If I cannot understand it, it does not exist." is the game of hide and seek of a child that says, "No! I can't see you, so you can't see me!"
This system of understanding breaks down once observed, it reveals itself as a funny game, with the added benefit of being a comfort of security.

# A New Religion Forms

This box view of understanding works for *most people*.
It's easy to see in understanding this mainstream religion that the reason the Gnostics [The group The Matrix is based off of], the students of deeper knowing and truths,
decided to reject the material world entirely as the enemy of knowledge itself. One could presume that they could see what was happening in the realm of school of thought movements,
that a new religion was forming, the religion of the worship of the material world. All value and man's focus and attention began to focus on the importance of the physical treasures and elements of Earth.
All that could be seen became that which was real, that which had value, and the purpose of life.
We can see now the devastating consequences of this religion. The worship of material items left man empty and unsatisfied, unhappy and depressed, eating and drinking of amazing treasures that did not fulfill them,
left eternally starving of thirst and hunger.
This was seen by the cursed pirates in Pirates of the Carribean, as all the pirates under the curse ate and drank their fill but it all turned to ash in their hearts, they had a thirst that no taste could satisfy or quench,
and their souls turned black.
This modern religion is the religion that all that you know is all there is, and this is a meaningless religion. A religion without purpose, with no goal worth reaching, the rewards as temporary as the apple after you eat it.

# Issue of Thought Arising

You may have noticed the problem with the problems of thoughts.
This is from that same author of "Rejecting the Burden of Proof" in which he is still trying to argue against religions.
*"They want to have their beliefs remain intact and not subject to refutation or to reexamination for fear of needing to alter their beliefs."*
There are some common elements of the mind of thoughts and beliefs. Beliefs have the tendency to be something that was, from the past.

Here is the proof that a system of logic is not enough. Thoughts and words are not understanding, they are not knowing, they are not meaning.
They are associated with knowing. When you say "The sky is blue", perhaps for the first time, you are observing that the sky is blue, you are knowing that the sky is blue.
There is a great deal of meaning associated with that statement. Tomorrow however, when you say "The sky is blue", you are echoing an old thought. Tomorrow, the knowledge,
the awareness, the knowing, the meaning associated with those words is no longer there. When you were there, you saw and knew what was real and associated words to it.
Tomorrow, all you have is words, that knowing may or may not have remained intact with them. When you tell another person tomorrow the sky is blue, if you no longer have the knowing,
of what good is it to you? Religions are this way. We keep words and beliefs as being true when they are no longer true.
The words that were true yesterday because they carried an association to great depth and meaning and knowing, today they are empty and formulaic, they mean nothing.
Most of the time when we have arguments, we are reciting ideas we once heard that we once concluded were true, but today we are only echoing a voice that once carried meaning.
If you write a journal of a moment of meaning to you today, see how those words may lose their depth tomorrow. The words can carry this meaning but they will not carry it forever.
"For the **letter** kills, but the Spirit gives life."

This religion of logic, and all religions have one thing in common, their words can become dead. In science, the limited understanding tries to find formulations of words to be still true tomorrow,
and this leaves us with only the most basic truths and simple facts in our existence. Only trivial information can be stored in these systems, such as that the sky is blue.
All beauty in that blue sky, any hint of meaning is lost in those three words. Those three words carry no understanding. Reflect on how true the words you say are the next time you are in an argument
with someone. Are you saying what you are saying with knowing, or are you repeating what you once agreed with?

# The Seeker

The system of believing that 'what is known is what is' will work for most people, but not for the seeker of truth. The one with a desire to find truth will walk a narrow path and will come to find
that this system will only carry him so far. The scientist who has decided to believe in the scientific method, the system of rules we designed to argue evidence, will become unsatisfied with the religion of
science he will eventually realize he has been involved in. He will eventually realize that if he follows the method and observes the data without judgement, that his material world is not all that is,
and that there is an infinite world of complexity that man does not understand, but knows this is there.

* Imagine the colleagues of the scientist who discovered germs, an unseen world that existed that they would tell him is not real! Imagine that we knew disease existed before we could
see germs! *

Most have heard this, but this is the case with Quantum Physics. Quantum physics should be *fringe science*, it should be outside of mainstream science because it deals with a world of the unseen and a world
that is not understood. We now have so much data and evidence that this cannot be denied as being real and observable by the scientific method, even though we do not understand it.
Every scientist who came into science with a passion will realize the absurdity of the religion he has found himself in, because the scientist is the explorer and the adventurer who sets out to discover
what is in the unknown, he sets out to figure out what is not known. He will discover the hypocrisy of the religion of science in that it wills say that what is unknown does not exist.
What began as a pursuit of the unknown ended in a formulaic religion of belief systems focused on a material world. This unsatisifies and troubles the truth seeker, and he will have to play a different game
than his colleagues.
This is what Carl Jung did. He set out as a scientist and established himself with a cult-like following of a herd of scientists, and eventually discovered that he was not at all a scientist.
He was a student of truth.
There is a level of understanding that one reaches in which they are no longer the child looking at the teacher and now they can see that the belief systems we live by are just that. Beliefs.
Do you believe in the subconscious mind? Do you know what that is? Is it real? The concept of your 'subconscious mind' is based on a model that someone created to attempt to understand data.
Have you ever seen it? No? But if you have explored it at all you may have encountered some evidence arising around it correct? Many of these models you have been exposed to as "what is" and
are models we've created to help us observe things we don't understand. You're using other people's theories that society has become familiar enough with to adopt.
Scientists like Jung were the ones who theorized the 'subconscious', a placeholder term to describe a supernatural phenomena, one that cannot be observed and yet we can obtain data for.
This is what the scientist realizes when he has access to testing the scientific method at scale.

The established scientific method involves not knowing what the conclusion is, not making a theory, but starting with a hypothesis, a sort of inquiry or question,
and then gathering data.
If one does not use the scientific method, if they have a conclusion and they seek data to prove it, they will find that data. Data is plentiful.
The honest scientist who honors this method will gather data and find that the data says that there is a world beyond his understanding,
and even one that he can track and find observable patterns of. Once he has access to scale, he will be able to gather data that empirically proves the existence of 'miracles'.

That Burden of Proof author stated, "There are those who will refuse to accept that the burden of proof rests with those making positive claims."
He means to say that evidence needs to be provided by the people stating that there is a supernatural world. He is in fact, wrong at scale.
The one saying that there is no supernatural world [a world that is not seen or understood yet] is the one without evidence.
The one who has had knowing and meaning and experiencing with the matter in question is the one with evidence.
The one who is telling the person that there is no unseen world is actually a betrayer the scientific method, he is being presented with evidence and he is rejecting it flat out.
He has no hypothesis, he is doing no testing, and he is rejecting the data in front of him.

This is what C.J. Jung had to deal with at scale, when he began to actually hypothesize and test the data available to him, he was able to see data that visualized an unseen world,
a world where figures such as Christ could appear to multiple people at different times as they claimed, or where multiple people could have the same dreams,
where the words a patient said could manifest in his life, where negative beliefs could result in a person becoming ill or catching diseases, where one could know of the death of
another before it occured, and where NDE became probably nearly as frequent as the common cold. The truth seeking scientist runs into the data that says one thing, whether or not
the material world understands it at all. Jung's studies eventually became metaphysical studies, and he likely reached a point where material science was not the focal point of
his real inquiries in the mysteries he was setting out to solve. He was not a "scientist" in this way. Sigmund Froyd was the same modern science is still built on these explorations, and world governments,
the U.S.A. and Nazi Germany were run based off of the analysis' of the unseen world, the forces these governments could channel labeled 'the collective unconsciousness', which in reality is a
fancy name for a model describing a supernatural, metaphysical plane of existence. See the documentary, ["Century of the Self" for more on this].

Make no mistake, there is nothing material or sciency about 'your subconscious'. This term is only for your comfort in a world that believes that 'that which exists is that which is seen and known'.
You likely by definition do believe in and understand the existence of a supernatural plane of existence right now [You have thoughts, don't you?], regardless of if you've recognized that
there have been fancy labels placed on those ideas.

On the terms of athiest and agnostic,

Athiesm is the religion of placing faith in what is currently understood and seen, even while existing in a world where you cannot see wind blowing,
even while existing in a world where once man could catch unseen diseases while no one could see germs. Imagine.
Agnosticism is a fancy word to admit that we don't know what is going on, and this is good. You can only learn if you don't yet know. Once you think you know, that's it, you can learn no more.
