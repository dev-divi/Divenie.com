I'm absolutely mind blown at this episode. Never in a million years would I have ever thought they made the shows main points this clear. 

I was sure that Eren being a monster since birth would remain something not entirely spelled out, allowing the audience to maintain the illusion that Eren is what we want to believe he is. Even I was swept away in the prior episode being disenchanted with the truth that Eren would never go along with Zeke, that he would never be anyone's pawn. 

I like that the main philosophical viewpoint of the show is made crystal clear as well, what they are really fighting for, is the curiosity of the human spirit. That casting a viel of ignorance or euthanizing people and never even giving them the chance to exist takes away the one possibility of youth that makes coming into this world matter.  This is what they're really protecting. 

Osho compared Adam and Eve to the human spirit as well, saying that partaking of the apple shows this curiosity as exactly what makes us human. He also seemed to have a lot of the same perspectives as AoT. 

amazing that we see that Eren is the **actual devil**, whispering thoughts of murdering a child into a conflicted man's ear. 

the true beauty of seeing that the man once held responsible for the actions of the "boy on trial"(Eren) is not only less off the main influence, the once blamed is also weak, 
and the true horror of the world these protagonists find themselves in is revealed in the horror of witnessing a man plead all he has to the villain of the show because our MC. is just that much worse. 

As this reality sinks in, the art style even turns from silent in moonlight into truly ghastly, vampirific and grotesque, capturing the same vibe of the art style of an anime of Shiki, a deeply disturbing anime that was horrific in its portrayal, 
themes here is a special kind of despair, [in Shiki] not only despair that there is no way out,but a despair that your god has abandoned you, the soul of the very world you live in seems to have turned black, and you too will be snuffed out into the night. Not just into the blackness, not into nothingness, but in a nothingness with evil and no hope for redemption, [Shiki and AoT] no rational thought to have to gain a sense of sanity, no way to justify your sins,

a despair in a claustrophobia that not only are you never going to make it out, but you are so insignificant to power that your life is an accidental fly on the wall, it is impossible to draw an illusion of the protection for you between life and death because the walls you are within is the constant certainty that everything that exists will be snuffed out and forgotten like a candle's flame. 

For a moment if we think about it we can remember what attack on Titan really is. These are not stories of war and courage and faith, from this moment, all of that was fiction. The reality was they were in a horror film with no way out, in which giant beings came to feed on them like livestock and they don't even know why. 

What I think means the most to me right now about this show is that Eren exists inside anyone who is aware enough to recognize it or has had the unluckiness to be placed inside a situation to encounter it. We instinctually often notice those that have been more in contact with it and move away from them, and it is that real devil, a black evil monster in us that would kill anyone, do anything, to get what it wants. This is what we hide from. Inside us are two voices that tell us the same message, "Keep going, don't give up", and while the lighter side has better reasons for going, the other side says, "I must not be trapped." This side, toxic, rejected, violent, hateful, cruel, malicious, angry, that one that has slipped out before and we don't know why, 
this is the consequence of curiosity. That need for curiosity says, "I must explore, I must find out", and this nature can only be maintained as long as one is never trapped, never held down by anyone. 

We don't encounter this unless we experience being trapped. It is the man who is imprisoned in any way that comes in contact with this nature, he will find a panic in his mind, a quiet scream of an alarm that does not cease, it screams in the most hidden part of his mind and the deepest part of his soul, like an itch that cannot be scratched, and it silent screams the  words "Keep moving forward. Keep going. Don't give up. ", instead the trapped victim screams "I have to get out of here. I have to escape. I have to see the sky again, I have to make it to the ocean."
That itch drives a man insane because it is everpresent, it is loud, scratching, and far away, and cannot be salved by any remedy.  
Both of these messages say the same thing with the same goal. While a man does not have to act on voices that tell him to do anything, try anything, say anything to **get out**, the exposure to this force leaves man with layers of dirt that others will instinctually see. This dirt is a prolonged exposure to being trapped. We hate this and instinctually move away from it. 

In Erens case, the voice that screams "let me out" or on the lighter side "keep moving forward" has not ceased even when he made it outside of the walls. Even when he arrives at the ocean, for most people would finally cease this voice, Eren does not feel free. He's been in a cage his entire life and he's still inside that cage. This is why he has to ask if he kills everyone on the other side of the ocean, will he be free? The answer is no.

 The boy who grew up into a man is a desperate creature driven to insanity to survive, and in his mind he cannot rest until he knows everyone is dead, this will never happen. If he killed all of his enemies, his friends could become a threat and he may have to kill them too. 
 
Eren was a boy more tapped into human curiosity, on both the dark and light side. Pressure exposed and brought out his darkness at an early age with Mikasa, and he is led to lean on the dark side out of his embarrassing weakness, being less skillful than every single other human around him,

This drives him to rely on both sides, in the background driven by his darkness while also consciously driven by his lighter ambitions in the face of the light, the nature to perservere and achieve and find victory are good things that cast him in the light. Eren does have good voices that lead him towards a better nature, these are the voices he is listening to in his comrades. They are his light voices, they are what keeps him tied to humanity.
[we see that he begins to lose himself to a violent nature early on as he gains exposure to the titan. ]

While Eren feeds on this power inside him, as the weak and powerless often do, and the trapped **always do** he is not only a devil but he **is** also good too. Erens story that he was born a monster is true, but this is not all of a story. His story overlooks the nature versus nurture argument, which in the case of this show becomes relevant. 

This again leads me to believe that the spiritual figure Osho's ideas or that of his contemporaries  played a heavy influence on the creator. 
Osho had a lecture describing that it would be better for humanity to be taught that we are born without souls, instead that we have to create them. 
This fits the character of Eren Jaeger, a person  that was born a monster with no soul, but who has grown a semblance of a soul within that darkness due to the kindness of others touching his heart. This may not be enough to save him from being ruled by his darkness[as far as I know at the time of this writing] but it does have an impact on his life. 

The model of consciousness painted by this that 
I agree with is that the hidden side that would do anything for curiousity and the visible side that matures in the light of day as it is exposed to the better parts of others and this world, they both exist within us, and as far as I understand it, we are ultimately pushed forward by both sides. We, the conscious side, have to try to fight to lean towards a light of consciousness, and not towards the ignorance of the hidden that comes from destruction, oppression, annihilation. 

Incredible that we are in such a time in the real world as ignorance spreads and no one can remember why ignorance is such a bad thing, why not just fall asleep into the darkness, why not forget, and this plot reminds us all the way from the beginning of some theology at Adam and Eve that curiosity is what makes us human, and casting us into ignorance for the offer of pleasure, allowing us to forget because we're so tired all we want to do is rest, 
And we cannot see that when no one can remember, when there is no awakeness, the children do not even get the option to do this one thing that makes them human, the ability to go beyond the wall, into the unknown to pursue their curiosity. 

Instead, the children in our future are born saturated into ignorance indoctrinated like the children of Marley. Their desires to leave the nest suppressed as they are lost in the ideas of ignorance from the world that envelopes them, and brought addicted to technology that they cannot leave the wall because they cannot survive without the tech. 

I don't know what I expected but I do know what happened, instead of direct warfare against the people, the people were conditioned to become so tired that when the time came, they gave up. 
They could not remember why there would be a reason to not allow themselves to fall asleep into the pleasure machine. 

The reason why is because the pleasure machine is the same as the forgetfulness curse of the Eldians. Once the spell is complete, once the spell is over everyone, no one can remember, no one can wake up, and the one who cast the spell can reshape the world as they desire, because humanity will not be able to even remember what it means to be a human. 

A century from now, all that we know about what it means to be a human today can be easily erased and replaced. The human experience for millenia going forward will be one in which you exist for a reason and that reason is definitely not to go outside the walls. 

It is incredible that we are here existing in a time where this true masterpiece of a series highlights and contrasts to the current state of reality, along with one of the last cries of the urging to see that there is meaning in this world, that it does matter to remain conscious and not be deceived by the comfort of ignorance. I am of course thinking about the younger generations, who, now born into a world of meaningless media that exists only for their pleasure and attention, are being sent a message that their lives do not matter, that life does not matter. It seems that the same children that have access to endless YouTube TV content also have access to anime like Attack on Titan, and I am grateful because this means that the children who would want to see beyond the wall, they will at least be sent the message that such a possibility may exist. 

Thank you so much for reading and blessings to you,
