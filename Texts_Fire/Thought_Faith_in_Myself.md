What an interesting experience, this different perception of what I could make. 
I feel inspired by looking at the website of another, and have always marveled at the confidence exuded 
by some. 
Now I have caught a taste of their spark and I see, when you share something amazing, when you know what you 
are creating, what is amazing is amazing! There is a place without fear here, in perfect creation. 
I have fought and gone far to have this level of simple enjoyment of the words I like listening to the sweet 
sound of. I cannot help but recognize that I am a curator, a cultivator or pleasant words. And how could I not love this?
